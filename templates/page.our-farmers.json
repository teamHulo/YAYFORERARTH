Did we disrupt an entire ecosystem just to mass-produce a single crop for use as a mere filler in a cosmetic product?\"  If the products we create fail to contribute to the betterment of our planet and the livelihoods of our farmers, then we must ask ourselves: Why are we using them at all?<br\/><br\/>Every component we incorporate into our products isn't just essential; it's sacred. We believe that the alchemy of our magical products is, in part, attributed to the environments from which these ingredients are born!
