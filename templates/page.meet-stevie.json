        "text": "<p>Hello - I’m Stevie! This probably has taken me a while to write but here we go. Once upon a time, on my 25th birthday while working as a barista in NYC, I decided to take on the challenge of being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cd48LW3qeNE\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cd48LW3qeNE\">trash free<\/a>, yeah I was that kinda girl, haha. What sparked this was my friend and hobby mycologist, Nico, always ranting and raving about how amazing mushrooms and fungi were. He let me borrow a book all about mycelium and I was hooked! What specifically blew me away were how these quiet yet powerful underground mycelia and fungi beings do SO much for our existence. A few being that they are recyclers, regenerators, and communicators of the natural world and without them, we probably wouldn’t exist in the way that we do. Anyways, getting to know Fungi led me on the path to believing that, I too, had the ability to be a steward of the planet like a little mushroom is!<br\/> SO this trash free journey meant using up everything in my house that was in plastic, and replacing it with zero waste items. Enter in skin care!  <\/p>",

In my later teens <br\/>and early twenties, I had acne and rashes all over my face <br\/>that lead to scarring, early loss of elasticity, and dark hyperpigmentation - so finding something that worked <br\/>for me was an obsession.<br\/><br\/> This led me to take matters into my own hands and to create something perfect for me. I started by taking a train to visit <br\/>small organic farmers at various markets and organic co-ops. Then I started doing trial and error crafting in my kitchen. <br\/>After perfecting the recipe, I did a little dance and proclaimed <br\/>“I HAVE DONE IT - I found my ride or die - I shall never use another lotion on my face again!” What was crazy was that <br\/>my face literally started glowing, my hyperpigmentation began fading - realizing that anything I used previously was inferior - and it all had to do with happy ingredients.  After this - I would take dreamy monthly trips to restock for my next personal batch; in complete bliss. <\/p>",

So I drew the label one night and took it to print at my local print press. That week I made a batch of 25 lotions in my kitchen and it sold out in under a minute - whoa! The most nerve wracking part was waiting for the reviews to see if anyone liked it - and low and behold - it has transformed so many people's lives just as much as it has transformed mine! The first year was a year of making 50-100 lotions at a time that would literally take me days of crafting - selling them out in seconds - and doing it all over again. Wow. <\/p><p><br\/>After almost a year of this craziness, my friend Sophie was recruited as the second member of Yay for Earth and our lives changed forever. I would create the magical golden potion in my Brooklyn kitchen and she would print the labels and pack them out and we would listen to podcasts and daydream. The growth has been so amazing that after years of making it myself in my personal kitchen, we were able to afford a YFE space to make lotions for you all more efficiently! Now we are a team of three - being able to recruit my cousin!<\/p>",
